##Description
C++ supervised learning library. Still work-in-progress.

Algorithms currently implemented: *K-Nearest Neighbors*.  

## How to run the executable
```
cd build; cmake ..; make; ./main
```
This will build the test program which will run the K-NN algorithm
on three different common datasets: *Iris*, *Wine*, and *Ecoli*, 
for the purpose of multiclass classification.
